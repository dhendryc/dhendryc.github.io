I am a PhD candidate at Sebastian Pokutta's [IOL Lab](https://iol.zib.de) at the [Zuse Institute Berlin](https://www.zib.de) and lead of the IOL.Opt area focusing in first-order optimization. My research interests are Frank-Wolfe methods, mixed-integer convex optimization and optimal experiment design.

In my free time, I love to read both fiction (fantasy, crime, horror) and non-fiction (mathematics, psychology, history, biographies). I am part of a women's choir and like to try out new art supplies.
